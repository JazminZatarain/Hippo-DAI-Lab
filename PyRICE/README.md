# The PyRICE Model

## Authored by Max Reddel

This is a simulation model implementation of the RICE2010 model by Nordhaus. It is modified in a way, such that alternative ethical problem formulations can be selected. Concretely, next to the standard `utilitarian` problem formulation, the user can alternatively choose a `prioritarian`, `sufficientarian`, or an `egalitarian` problem formulation.

## 1. General Remarks

This project has been developed within an internship at the **Hippo DAI Lab** at the **TU Delft** during the academic year 2021/22 between quarter 1 and quarter 2. This model is based on the work of Ivar Tjallingii who developed a working version of PyRICE. The contribution of Max Reddel lies in refactoring the PyRICE model, such that modularity, object-orientation, and thus reusability are enabled. Ivar's original model can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/itjallingii/PyRICE2020).

## 2. Uncertainty Modules
The PyRICE has been connected to the SSP scenarios by aggregating country statistics into 12 RICE regions. Extra climate uncertainties have been added to analyze the expsosure of alternative abatement pathways to deep uncertainty in climate change. Within the model, it can be switched between a long-term and short-term uncertainty analysis. 

To use the uncertainty modules, additional packages need to be installed to connect to the [EMA-workbench](https://emaworkbench.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The `model` directory contains all model relevant components, including the main model `pyrice`, its submodels, data sets, etc. You can run the model by using the notebook `simulation.ipynb` which provides a walkthrough the most important parameters, how to run the model, and how to view the results. Verification can be found in the `verficiation` folder. There are two ways of verification. In `verification/rice`, the PyRICE model results are compared against the original RICE2010 model by Nordhaus. In `verification/pyrice`, one can find the components to check whether the original model results by Ivar Tjanllingii are the same as the current model results after refactoring. This way of verification has been introduced to make sure that the model yields the same results after refactoring.

## 4. The PyRICE Model

### 4.1 Model Flow 


The model uses four sub-models: `economy_model`, `carbon_cycle_model`, `climate_model`, and `utility_model`. Each is responsible for its own domain. The flow within one time step is depicted below.

### 4.2 XLRM 

Within the XLRM framework, the PyRICE model can be represented as seen in the figure 2.

| RICE Region                 |  Description   |

| `OECD-Europe` | European countries that are members of the OECD |

## 5 How to Use the PyRICE Model

### 5.1 Intialize the PyRICE Model

The most important parameters are listed below. Use simply **`model = PyRICE()`** with the following parameters.


### Model Parameters

**Bolded** elements are model default values.

| Variable | Values | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `model_specification` | **`ModelSpec.STANDARD`** <br> `ModelSpec.Validation_1` <br> `ModelSpec.Validation_2` | Standard for simulation and optimizaiton <br> Replicating RICE2010 <br> Deterministic RICE2010|
| `damage_function` | **`DamageFunction.NORDHAUS`** <br> `DamageFunction.NEWBOLD` <br> `DamageFunction.WEITZMAN` | Nordhaus + SLR <br> Newbold & Daigneault <br> Weitzman |
| `welfare_function` | **`WelfareFunction.UTILITARIAN`** <br> `WelfareFunction.EGALITARIAN` <br> `WelfareFunction.SUFFICIENTARIAN` <br> `WelfareFunction.PRIORITARIAN`| Total aggregated utility <br> Equal distribution of risks & benefits <br> People above some threshold  <br> Wellbeing of worst-off region|

### 5.2 Run the PyRICE Model
Next, we can run the model with specific lever values. The most important parameters are listed below. The default values of the lever parameters represent the **original Nordhaus policy**. 

If the model has been initialized with e.g., `model = PyRICE()`, we can simply use the call function `model()` with the parameters below.

### Levers

| Variable        | Values          | Default       | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------    | ----------- |
| `sr`            | `[0.1, 0.5]`    | `0.248`       | Savings rate |
| `miu`           | `[2005, 2305]`  | `2135`        | Emission control rate target (year of zero-emission)|
| `irstp`         | `[0.001, 0.015]`| `0.015`       | Initial rate of social time preference |

### Miscellaneous Parameters

| Variable        | Values          | Default       | Description |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------    | ----------- |
| `precision`     | `{10, 20, 30}` | `10`           | Precision of timeseries data of final outcomes in years |


Precision indicates how precise you want your timeseries data to be in the final outcomes. E.g., `10` means, you get a value every 10 years.

### 5.3 View Results

Running the model will return a dictionary containing all outcome variables. This dictionary is handy for conducting further optimization. It is, however, not handy, to inspect the results.

An alternative data structure for this is in form of a `Results` object which is also saved within the model and contains the same information as the dictionary.

With `results = model.get_better_formatted_results()`, you will get this object.

All relevant outcome data is saved into a `results` object and can be accessed via its attributes. Results is an object that contains several pandas dataframes and 3 highly aggregated float variables.

### Results

| Attribute                 |  Data Type        | Description   |
| -----------------------   | ---------------   | ----------    |
| `aggregated_utility`      | `float`           | Total aggregated utility   |
| `aggregated_utility_gini` | `float`           | Total aggregated utility GINI   |
| `aggregated_impact_gini`  | `float`           | Total aggregated impact GINI   |
| `df_population`           | `dataframe`       | Population over regions over years |
| `df_cpc`                  | `dataframe`       | Consumption per capita over regions over years   |
| `df_cpc_pre_damage`       | `dataframe`       | Pre-damage consumption per capita over regions over years |
| `df_cpc_post_damage`      | `dataframe`       | Post-damage consumption per capita over regions over years  |
| `df_main`                 | `dataframe`       | Over years with following columns: <br> - damages <br> - utility lowest income per capita <br> - highest climate impact per capita <br> - distance to threshold <br> - population under threshold <br> - intratemporal utility GINI <br> - intratemporal impact GINI <br> - atmospheric temperature  |




You can also view the attributes in a convenient way with the method `model.view_better_formatted_results()`.
